# movie_viewer

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is a complete code file of the project movie_viewer.
There was 3 different apis in document but I have used only first API and router data from one screen to another. I didnt use other 2 apis in the document becuase all 3 apis were showing different data, In first api there was different amount of popular movie and in search api I was getting different movies.

In document it was recommend to use multiple packages of flutter e.g flutter bloc, retrofit, freezed, mocktail I only used bloc package becuase that was only package I found useful for this app, I didnt use retrofit becuase I made my model class using quicktype.io it is easier and faster than using retrofit and json serializable.
